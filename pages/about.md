Hello There!
My name is DaCreepyPenguin, I am a computer science student in the UK and this is my site.
I Started this site to encourage myself to program more, to help myself learn through reinforcing my memory with posts, and to have some fun telling people about my stupid ideas!

### More Information

I have been interested in programming for a very long time now however at first I was focusing on the performing arts, now I spend a lot of my time working on computers and have found myself studying computer science at college with performing as just a hobby. I hope to one day join the military and maintain programming as a fun side thing and never let it become a boring job.
