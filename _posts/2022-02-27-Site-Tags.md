I'm now introducing site tags.

I have spent most of today working on this new functionality thanks to a tutorial from [this page](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/){:target="_blank"}. You can now find different posts through their associated tags and there will eventually be more functionality built into them.

My next few jobs is to make project pages for my current projects, an improvement to the home page which will display more than just my posts, pinned posts, and some kind of tool to help me produce these posts, tags, and pages (which will probably be some kind of software built in c# or py).

p.s I also added a favicon, not really important but I thought it was cool
