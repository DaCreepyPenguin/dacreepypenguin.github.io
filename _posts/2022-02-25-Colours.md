I have tried to make the site look a bit more recognizable to my colour scheme however I think there is a lot of work to do. 

I need to add more difference in colours and build a full colour pallet to work from. I also think my other pages and accounts aren't all coloured correctly (NTS: I should go through all my social media things and make sure it all looks right)
